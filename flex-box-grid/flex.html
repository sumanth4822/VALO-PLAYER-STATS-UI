            <h1>Kumara Parvatha Trek
                The Most Challenging Trek in the Western Ghats of Karnataka.</h1>
                <p>Kumara Parvatha is situated in the Western Ghats of Karnataka. At the foothills lies an ancient and famous temple called Kukke Subrahmanya.The temple is filled with history and holds a lot of importance among the locals.

                    People from all over the country, especially from South India visit the temple to get their wishes fulfilled by making offerings. Devotees fill the temple premises almost all the time.
                    
                    Right behind the Kukke Subrahmanya temple, standing tall is Shesha Parvatha, with its thick blanket of lush green forest of the Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary.
                    
                    Kumara Parvatha or Pushpagiri is the name of the peak which is hidden most of the time and is visible only after crossing Shesha Parvatha, but the entire trail is popularly known as the Kumara Parvatha trek.</p>

            Kumara parvatha trek is one of the toughest treks in South India.This trek can be divided for 2 days. The camping sites are available at : Bhatra Mane, Kallu Mantapa(Water source available) and the peak itself.Make sure you carry enough water and energy drink/bars. The trek has different vegetation: Initial trek from kukke side is through dense forest for about 2 hours and then the next 1 hour trek to the bhatra mane is through the grassland. You can have lunch and take some rest at bhatra mane.Later you need to take permission from the forest dept and pay treakking fee of Rs 200. you will continue to ascend in the grassland where you come across Kallu Mantapa, where you can camp for the night and enjoy the sunset(Very scenic). The next day, start early and continue towards shesha parvatha(just before kumara parvatha), the view from here is amazing. The next 1 hour trek to the destination i.e., Kumara parvatha is inside the forest and the moment ypu reach the peak, you can see and feel the fog all over. The clouds will literally be below us. It offers breathtaking views. You can plan your descend either towards kukke side(same route as the ascend) or towards Somwarpete side which is inside forest and you come across small waterfalls in this route.

            The trek is pretty tough if it's a sunny day. The total trek is of about 14kms out of which 8kms are covered in forest but the remaining 6kms are completely open, not a single place for shade. The view is pretty good but nothing extraordinary. Surprisingly, it was pretty hot even on a January night.
I would recommend reaching the forest check post sometime in the afternoon and camp there, then start for the peak next day early morning.

            It's the longest trek in Karnataka. Located in Western Ghats right behind Kukke Subramnya temple. There are two ways to start this trek, one from Somawarpete side and one from Kukke side. From Somawarpet reaching peak is easier. From Kukke, the climb is more strenuous and long. Overall a good trek after you have finished few one day treks nearby Bangalore.

            Pushpagiri is one of the most challenging trek in south india. Nearlr 15 km one side frome base point to peak. 8 km from the base point we can find "battrumane", where we can stay and have food. Nearby that only we can find forest office where we have to pay trekking fees before moving on to the peak.The last 8 kilometers trail is through top of the hills with extreme high temperature where our endurance will be tested. Finally we reached peak at 3:45 PM. We started the trek at 7:30 AM. 6 of us started from the base point, only 3 of us managed to reach the peak. During the night, we had fire amp near forrest office we will be allowed stay with our tents. Overall its an awesome experience and it is a heaven for adventure lowers.
